# Lab 4: Blog Platform Client

*Here is my Blog project for Lab 4 in CS52. It is a CRUD-based sharing platform that allows people to post blog posts that persist.*

## What Worked Well

The react and redux combination was very useful. Once I understood how it worked, it was very simple to make things happen from there. 

## What Didn't

It was difficult to work on just the front-end at a time without thinking about the back-end, as I wasn't sure which things could happen without others.

## Extra Credit

* There is an error-handling reducer through redux!
* There is input validation to make sure that each input field is filled before making a new note
* There's a lot of CSS animation and hover effects!
  * my favorite is when you make a new note, if the input field is filled, the title lights up!
